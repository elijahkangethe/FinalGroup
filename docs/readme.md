History of Apple’s Modern Success 

	Apple is one of the most influential computer manufacturers in the world aside from other leading computer companies like HP, Dell, Acer, and many others. However, what sets Apple apart from it’s competitors is that Apple has been massively successful and holds a strong financial stakehold in the smartphone industry. For example, in the History channel Article “Steve Jobs debuts the iPhone”. Highlight’s Apple’s sales figures for the iPhone. The History channel states. “When it went on sale in the United States six months later, on June 29, amidst huge hype, thousands of customers lined up at Apple stores across the country to be among the first to purchase an iPhone. In November 2007—by which point more than 1.4 million iPhones had been sold” (History Channel Editors) Therefore, Apple was able to generate a tremendous amount of revenue when it’s first iPhone debuted. Likewise, when a company creates a new product and if it does well then consumers will likely buy the next iteration of that product. Likewise, when customers by the “thousands”(History Channel) wait outside of a store for a single product it is evident that there was immense demand for the iPhone because Apple was already a reputable company for their computers. Therefore, consumers were likely looking forward to Apple’s next product because possibly some customers who bought the iPhone already owned and trusted Apple’s products. The Apple iPhone’s features are clearly listed on Apple’s website “https://www.apple.com/iphone/”. Moreover, Apple improved the way people used phones because adding touch screen functionality and an easy to use interface to talk, text, listen to music, and browse the internet was effective. Likewise, prior to the iPhone the majority of phones could not browse the internet and did not have many features aside from talking and texting. Likewise, the added convenience of a multimedia device like an iPhone likely made consumers think the iPhone was an effective deal because people who bought the iPhone did not have to carry and iPod as well just to listen to music. The Apple iPod’s features are listed on Apple’s website. “https://www.apple.com/ipod-touch/specs/” Therefore, Apple creating the iPhone revolutionized the smartphone market because they introduced an affordable device that enabled people to browse the internet and the iPhone’s early success led to the creation of subsequent Apple iPhones and Apple has had massive success ever since the iPhone’s debut.

pple is an influential technology company that has numerous popular products, but one of their largest successes besides the iPhone is the Apple iPod which dramatically changed the way people listened to music. Likewise, the iPod has numerous features that made it an extremely popular MP3 playing device. The Wired article “Apple’s ‘breakthrough’ iPod” written by Brad King Farhad Manjoo Underlines the iPod’s features when it debuted. Manjoo states “Apple has introduced a new digital music device called the iPod that can store 1,000 songs and copy a CD in 10 seconds. About the size of a pack of cards, the 6.5 ounce portable device is based on a 5-gigabyte hard drive.”(Manjoo)
Therefore, the ability to have 1000 songs on a device as small as an iPod is incredible for Apple Customers because a person can listen to their favorite songs and not have to carry around CDs, bulky cassette players, or other inefficient music listening devices. Moreover, because music on an iPod is stored internally the customer does not have to swap out CDs or cassette tapes. However, because an iPod is a wireless device it does need to be charged or the device will not play music, but it is a small inconvenience for how efficient it is to listen music with an iPod. Therefore, Apple’s iPod was an influential device because it enabled people to more conveniently listen to music.
